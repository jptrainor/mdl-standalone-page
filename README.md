# mdl-standalone-page

An example [standalone web page] (http://jptrainor.github.io/mdl.standalone.html) that demonstrates use of Google's [Material Design Lite](https://www.getmdl.io) css library. Defines a simple header, footer, a scrolling content section, and uses Google's Roboto font.

This example is a severely cut down version of Google's [Web Start Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit). It was created to mimic the layout of a simple
Polymer application with a narrow, single row, header. Specifically, it was created so that a redirect out of a [Polymer] (https://www.polymer-project.org) application to an external, static, web page would not result in a jarring style change.

Many thanks to Google for providing an abundance of great development tools.
